subfolders include input scripts used for slim simulations
 and input parameters for DFE-alpha analyses

main files are scripts to convert slim output into SFS files and analyze with DFE-alpha, or to take C elegans SFS data and analyze with DFE-alpha, respectively
    all the .R files are called from within the .sh scripts, and mainly perform data manipulation of the file formats
    all the "CommandLine..." files are called within the "RunScript... .sh" files
    Each "RunScript.... .sh" script is referring to a specific analysis set of either the whole genome, or separated into just genome arms or centers, as well as for unfolded versus folded SFS
